This is the final project for CS5200f17, and the goal of the project is to gain hands-on experience with developing a full database application from the ground up. 

We created an web application called Trainly.io which use MySQL as back-end database, and use Express.js, Angular.js, and Node.js 
to create front-end web app and connect it with the database.

Functions:
a) Register a new user (studnet, faculty and/or admin)
b) As an administrator, authenticate a faculty user (based upon title/affiliation/website/email) or fellow
administrator
c) Provide a categorized list of a studentâ€™s courses (each with primary/secondary topics, ranked by
average evaluation score): currently enrolled, completed, of interest
d) Enroll a student in a course
e) For a student enrolled in a course, list materials, in order, indicating the line of demarcation between
completed/not completed
f) Mark course material as having been completed by a student (possibly resulting in course completion)
g) Provide a certificate of completion for a student (assuming s/he has successfully completed all materials)
h) Provide an account history for a user: dates of enrollment/completion for each course, amount paid
(with confirmation code), and total spent.
